       1.  Dependency 'androidx.media3:media3-exoplayer-hls:1.8.0' requires libraries and applications that
           depend on it to compile against version 35 or later of the
           Android APIs.

           :app is currently compiled against android-34.

           Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
           of at least 35, for example 36.

           Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
           allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
           targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and

           on).
